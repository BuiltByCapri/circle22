    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>
      Circle 22 is a structured evening for single professionals who value thoughtful conversation and deliberate connection.
      It is not a dating app, a networking event, or an open mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each gathering is small, between 16 and 24 people, and designed around shared context: a theme, a question,
      or a format that rewards presence.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      You request an invitation through a brief form. We review each request individually and extend invitations based on alignment with the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatherings happen on a periodic basis. There are no tickets, no walk-ins, and no plus-ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>
      Circle 22 is designed for professionals in their 30s, 40s, and early 50s who are looking for something more considered than apps or large social events.
    </p>
    <p><strong>This is not for everyone. That’s intentional.</strong></p>
